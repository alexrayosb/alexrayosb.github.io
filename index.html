            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Alex Osborne, a dedicated student of computer science with a particular interest in solving data related problems. My journey with coding began in college where I slowly discovered a passion for projects involving databases and data analysis. In pursuing this interest, I have gained hands-on experience in designing, managing, optimizing, cleaning, and visualizing various types of data and databases. Notably, I have worked on optimizing C++ extensions for PostgreSQL by translating them to Rust, and recommending where Intel’s sustainability team should build their next data center through data visualizations. I am always eager to take on new challenges in computer science, data science, or any related fields! My goal is to leverage the skills and experiences I’ve acquired to create impactful solutions that drive innovation.</p>
