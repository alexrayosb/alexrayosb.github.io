Not only did it give me a glimpse into what level PhD research is at, I also had the opportunity to work with group members and receive constructive guidance. However, this was the first time I had not been fully pleased with the outcome of my best academic efforts. Despite feeling frustrated from falling short of my initial goals, I have been motivated by the group that took me in and Iâ€™ve learned a lot from the experience.</li>
