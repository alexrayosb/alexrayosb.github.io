                <li><a href="project1.html">Project 1</a>: My first attempt at undergraduate research is without a doubt the most important project I have worked on so far. Not only did it give me a glimpse into what level PhD research is at, I also had the opportunity to work with and ask group members for help. However, this was also the first time I had not been fully pleased with the outcome of my efforts. Despite feeling frustrated from falling short of my goals, I have been motivated by the group that took me in and Iâ€™ve learned a lot from the experience.</li>
